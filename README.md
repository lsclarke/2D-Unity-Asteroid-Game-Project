The 2D Asteroid Game Project is a Unity project I made in 1 weeks. This project was created as a way to not only help me but others. During my time as an instructor on my own time I developed this project as a way to help my students learn the basics of Unity Programming for a 2D game. This project touches on fundamental concepts when it comes to game development. Object oriented programming, understanding the use of components to help create a unique feel to the game as you play. It also focuses on understanding utilizing the Rigidbody component to create game physics, and learning how to call on objects to spawn as projectiles.
